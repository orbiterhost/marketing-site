When Justin and I first started Orbiter we made a [manifesto](https://orbiter.host/blog/the-static-website-manifesto) to put the joy back into building static sites, and along with that we have used open technologies such as IPFS and blockchain to counter the walled gardens that surround so many hosting platforms. After two months of building Orbiter we’ve also realized that so far our main customers are other developers who are like us, that just want a simple hosting experience with open ended infrastructure. We want to thank all of our users who have supported us along the way, and we want to commit to developers even more. That’s why today we are announcing that all of Orbiter is now GPL 3.0 licensed open sourced software!

Free and Open Sourced Software (FOSS) is fundamental to how all developers write code today. As I write this post I can only imagine the myriad of packages, repos, and lines of code that have been compounded over the years to make my words appear on the screen. By creating and maintaining open source software the world is able to move forward in ways most people can only dream. It’s also brings together people who are passionate about particular projects, to a point where developers around the world collaborate on software to make it better and improve the lives of everyday people.

This is our desire with Orbiter, to make static website hosting easy and to provide software that other developers can use to build out their own ideas. We want to be transparent with how your websites are being handled and cared for, and we would love to see other developers come along side us to help make it even better.

To truly build a website hosting platform without walled gardens, we need to do it together, and it starts today. Check out our list of repos below and give them a star if you feel like it, and if you haven’t already, [try launching your site on Orbiter today](https://orbiter.host)!
