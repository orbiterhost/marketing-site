Orbiter is built on a [very specific set of technologies](https://orbiter.host/blog/how-we-use-blockchain-behind-the-scenes). Like technology should, ours stays out of the way. It doesn’t expect anyone to understand the inner workings of the tech to be able to use the software. Instead, Orbiter is designed for everyone. And everyone knows how to upload files. That said, the technology we chose enables a fun and really useful feature—version history. 

If you’ve every played with the Internet Archive’s [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/), you’ve seen how great it is to have a website’s history. You can see how things have changed over time. We’ve built that experience into Orbiter. 

Every site update you make creates a new version. Those versions are indexed, regardless of your plan. However, for paid customers, we enable a view of your sites’ version histories. In this view, you can preview past versions, and with a click, restore your site to any of those versions.

Version history is searchable and always updating behind the scenes. Use it to explore your site’s history or fix issues quickly. Reverting to a previous version takes just seconds.
