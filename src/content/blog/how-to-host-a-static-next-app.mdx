Next.js is by far one of the most popular frontend frameworks out there. It provides a React like experience but with the ability to add server side API routes and rendering. Despite being primarily server side rendered, you can still host a Next.js app on Orbiter as a static site! In this post we‚Äôll show you how to do just that and demonstrate just how easy it is. Let‚Äôs get started!

Of course you will need all the basics:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A text editor like VSCode (or Zed if you‚Äôre cool ;) )
- [A free Orbiter account](https://app.orbiter.website)

Once you‚Äôre ready to go let‚Äôs run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-site
```

From there you can select your preferences; for me that‚Äôs gonna all the defaults to keep it simple. Once it‚Äôs finished installing dependencies run `cd my-site` and open the project in your text editor. Run `npm run dev` to preview the site, and just for fun let‚Äôs edit the `app/page.tsx` file. You‚Äôll see this near the top:

```tsx
<Image
  className="dark:invert"
  src="/next.svg"
  alt="Next.js logo"
  width={180}
  height={38}
  priority
/>
```

Replace that with this header:

```tsx
<h1 className="text-7xl">ORBITER</h1>
```

Cool üòé¬†Now let‚Äôs launch our site into orbit. To do that we‚Äôll need to edit the `next.config.ts` file and replace it with this code:

```tsx
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: 'export'
};

export default nextConfig;
```

In here we‚Äôre adding the `output` as `'export'` so we can make a static build folder. Once you edit and save that file, run the following command to build the site:

```bash
npm run build
```

This should result in a folder called `out` that has all of our HTML, CSS, and JS. From here there‚Äôs a few ways we could deploy our site to Orbiter. One simple way is by logging into [app.orbiter.host](http://app.orbiter.host), clicking ‚ÄúUpload Site‚Äù in the top right, select that `out` folder, give it a name, then click ‚ÄúCreate!‚Äù

For me personally I love using the terminal and CLIs, and thankfully Orbiter has a dead simple CLI to make deployments a breeze. First install the CLI using this command:

```bash
npm i -g orbiter-cli
```

Then authorize the CLI with one of the two options:

```bash
# Login with an OAuth provider
orbiter login -p google # or github

# Use an API key from https://app.orbiter.host/api-keys
orbiter auth
```

All that‚Äôs left is to run the `deploy` command!

```bash
orbiter deploy
```

This will prompt you to create a new site, enter in the subdomain you want to use (e.g. `my-site.orbiter.website`), ask for your build command (e.g. `npm run build`), and your build directory, which in our case will be `out`. After running this it will save the site info in `orbiter.json` at the root of your project, so whenever you have an update you can just run `orbiter deploy` again without having to fill anything out!

There you have it: a Next.js app hosted on IPFS and Base, without any fuss or waiting for builds to finish in the cloud. That‚Äôs the beauty of Orbiter! If you haven‚Äôt already, give Orbiter a shot for your next project (pun intended) and see why more and more developers are trusting it every day!
