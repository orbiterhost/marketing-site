We built Orbiter as a simple hosting solution in a world of failed CD/CI pipelines and complex build setups. It can even be an escape from Git as we recently just added Version support, making it easy to rollback or preview a previous version of your website. However with all of these features, we should also say you can still use Git in your workflow and even automate your Orbiter deployments. I (Steve) personally love working in the terminal and have written about it frequently, and it’s also why I love building CLIs. I built the Orbiter CLI as a tool for those like me who want the best of both worlds: simplicity with terminal access.

One of those special terminal tools not many people are familiar with are [Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks). These are scripts you can run based on certain Git conditions, and in this post we’ll show you how you can easily make a Git Hook to deploy your Orbiter site after you commit some changes. Let’s get started!

## Setup

One simple thing you need here is Git installed on your machine, but most of them come with it out of the box. If not simply follow [this guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). If you haven’t already you should follow one of our guides to hosting on Orbiter, like this one for [React](https://orbiter.host/blog/how-to-host-a-react-site) or this one for [Astro](https://orbiter.host/blog/how-to-host-an-astro-site). Both of those initialize the repo with Git, but in the case they didn’t it’s very easy to do. Just run the following command:

```bash
git init
```

The other piece you’ll need is the Orbiter CLI which can be installed with just one command:

```bash
npm i -g orbiter-cli
```

Once you’ve downloaded the CLI run the login command with your provider of choice, `google` or `github`.

```bash
orbiter login -p google
```

Last thing you need to do is build your site and then upload it to Orbiter. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
npm run build && orbiter create -d mysite ./dist
```

The first one creates the `dist` folder, the second creates a site with the domain `mysite.orbiter.website`, and uses the `dist` folder we just built.

## Creating the Hook

Now that we have all our pieces in place we can build our Git hook. This one will do the following after we commit changes:

- Build our site
- Update our site with the new `dist` folder

If you run `ls -a` in your terminal you should see something called `.git`; this is actually a folder with all of our Git information like commits and settings. In there by default is another folder called `hooks`, and that’s where we’ll create our post commit hook. Run the following command inside your terminal:

```bash
touch .git/hooks/post-commit
```

Now you’ll want to open this new file with your text editor of choice. Once you open the blank file paste in the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Path: .git/hooks/post-commit
# Make sure to make this file executable: chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit

echo "Running orbiter update..."
# Run the CLI command here
npm run build && orbiter update -d <your-domain> dist

# Alternatively you can use the --siteId instead
# orbiter update -s <site-id> dist

# Check if the command was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Orbiter update completed successfully"
    exit 0
else
    echo "Orbiter update failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

This is a pretty simple bash script that will run a few commands:

- `npm run build` - Creates a `dist` folder for the latest version of our site
- `orbiter update -d <your-domain> dist` - Updates our site using the new `dist` folder. We set which site using the -d flag followed by our subdomain. For instance, if I have a site called [`astro.orbiter.website`](http://astro.orbiter.website) then I would use `-d astro`.

Make sure these are both adjusted for your setup, whether you’re using Yarn instead of NPM or your build folder is name something other than `dist`. Also of course make sure you update the domain! Save your changes then in the terminal run this command:

```bash
sudo chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

This will turn your Git hook into an executable bash script. Now we can test it out! Make a change to your website then commit it like so:

```bash
git add .

git commit -m "Testing Git hooks!"
```

Then you should see the build compiling and the update to your website made!

## Wrapping Up

Git is really powerful, and there’s a reason it’s become the default version managing software used around the world. While there’s a lot you can do with it, for most people you may just want a simple way to undo a deployment or mistake you made to restore your website. In which case definitely check out our versions feature which makes it a breeze to update your site to an older version.
